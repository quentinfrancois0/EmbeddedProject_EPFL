-- 2 process :
--	Process to generate the clock during the whole simulation
--	Process to test the component
--
-- 3 procedures :
--	Procedure to toggle the reset
--	Procedure to write a register
--	Procedure to read a register
--
-- Tests done :
--	Writing the internal clock divider register
--	Writing the internal duty cycle register
--	Writing the internal polarity register
--	Writing the internal control register
--	Reading the internal duty cycle register
--	Reading the internal counter register
--
-- All the writing actions allow to generate a PWM signal with a 5,12 us period and a 62.7% duty cycle.
